# UniPrep Application Improvements

## Summary of Changes

### 1. âœ… **Fixed Groq Model Issues**
- **Problem**: The application was using deprecated Groq models (`llama3-8b-8192`, `llama3-70b-8192`) that have been decommissioned
- **Solution**: Updated to official working Groq models:
  - `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (default)
  - `llama-3.1-8b-instant`
  - `mixtral-8x7b-32768`
  - `gemma2-9b-it`
- **Files Modified**: `app.py` (lines 96, 162, 1419-1427)

### 2. âœ… **Improved MCQ Display Format**
- **Problem**: MCQs were displayed in dropdowns (expanders) making them hard to read and cluttered
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed dropdown/expander format
  - Created clean, simple layout with clear spacing
  - Each question displays on its own with:
    - Bold question text
    - Options with the correct answer highlighted in green with âœ…
    - Clear "Correct Answer" indicator
    - Well-formatted explanation
  - Added dividers between questions for better readability
- **Files Modified**: `app.py` (function `format_mcqs_for_display`, lines 586-660)

### 3. âœ… **Added Professional PDF Download**
- **Problem**: MCQs could only be downloaded as plain text files
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `generate_pdf_from_mcqs()` function using ReportLab library
  - Professional PDF formatting with:
    - Custom title and subtitle
    - Color-coded text (questions, answers, explanations)
    - Proper spacing and layout
    - Clean typography with Helvetica fonts
  - Two download options now available side-by-side:
    - ðŸ“„ Download as Text
    - ðŸ“• Download as PDF (primary button)
- **Files Modified**: `app.py` (lines 654-825, 2093-2107)
- **Dependencies Added**: `reportlab>=4.0.0` in `requirements.txt`

### 4. âœ… **MongoDB Integration for Question History**
- **Problem**: No way to save or retrieve previously generated MCQs
- **Solution**: 
  - Added full MongoDB integration
  - New sidebar section: **ðŸ’¾ MongoDB Storage**
    - User ID input for tracking
    - MongoDB URI connection
    - Connection status indicator
  - New sidebar section: **ðŸ“š My PDF Questions**
    - View history of previously generated MCQs
    - Display metadata (PDF name, difficulty, question count, date)
    - Click to view saved questions
    - Auto-refresh capability
  - Automatic saving: MCQs are automatically saved to MongoDB when generated
  - Database structure:
    ```javascript
    {
      user_id: "user_identifier",
      pdf_name: "document.pdf",
      mcqs_text: "full MCQ text...",
      num_questions: 5,
      difficulty: "Medium",
      created_at: Date(),
      timestamp: "2025-10-30T..."
    }
    ```
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app.py` (imports, session state, helper functions, sidebar UI)
  - Lines 54-61: MongoDB imports
  - Lines 97-102: MongoDB session state
  - Lines 215-278: MongoDB connection and CRUD functions
  - Lines 1842-1923: Sidebar MongoDB UI
  - Lines 2075-2080: Auto-save on MCQ generation
- **Dependencies Added**: `pymongo>=4.6.0` in `requirements.txt`

2. Get your MongoDB connection string
3. Enter it in the sidebar under "MongoDB Storage"
4. Optional: Add a User ID to track your questions
5. Click "Connect to MongoDB"

### Example MongoDB URI
```
mongodb://localhost:27017/  # Local
mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/  # Atlas
```

## Testing Checklist
